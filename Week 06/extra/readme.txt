My new program, code.c is the program that encrypt the sentence and decrypt it again.

By starting it with ./code, you should write sentence in enc function. Then, it goes to the enConv function that encrypts your sentence. In the function, the random number will be set and it will be added to each character's ASCII CODE. Then, the random number will be saved in the string as a key, and the encrypted sentence will show.

Then, the encrypted sentence will go to the dec function that decrypts your code. It will send the code to deConv and decrypt the code with the opposite way of encrypting.
