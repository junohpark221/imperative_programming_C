This is the program of encryption and decryption.
Basically, by using a doubly linked node, the characters that is used in the given sentence will be rearranged. In this time, I arranged the characters through the rules:
When the character is ith character, if (i+1) is divided by 3, it will be located to the leftside of previous character. If (i+1) is not divided by 3, it will be located to the rightside of the previous character.

I chose number 3, because it could remix the characters well and it will not be look like regular at once.
However, if I change the way to arranging, it will be more complicate encryption.
Also, if I use another character that is not used in the given sentence, it also will be more complicated.

Above of the line(//-------------------) is the part of test.
